# Appointment-Alert
Built for a hospital to use in clinical waiting rooms. Patients provide their contact information, and clerks can send a notification when the patient is being called. This allows the patient to explore or get food to eat while they are waiting.


This Web application was built for the purpose of alerting patients or family members in hospital clinic waiting rooms that the clinic is ready for them. Occupants have the option to provide their email and/or phone number upon arrival. Afterward, they may walk around the hospital, get a bite to eat, or take a phone call elsewhere, and the clinic clerk can use the Website to send them an email, text, or both, to indicate that they are now ready for them. The messages sent to the patient/family member contain a link that once clicked, confirms for the clerk that it has been received and that the person is on the way back to the clinic.
